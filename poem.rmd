The first story I ever write  
is a bright crayon picture  
of a dancing tree, the branches  
tossed by island wind.  

I draw myself standing beside the tree,  
with a colorful parrot soaring above me,  
and a magical turtle clasped in my hand,  

and two yellow wings fluttering  
on the proud shoulders of my ruffled  
Cuban rumba dancer's  
fancy dress.
